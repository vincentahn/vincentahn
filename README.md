### Why hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vincent Ahn and I am a software developer with experience in building complex web applications that enjoys improving incrementally day by day.

Currently I am working at AbleTo's Care Delivery team where we are developing an interactive template for therapists and behavioral coaches to use during sessions with their patients.

When I'm not coding, I usually spend my time playing FPS/MOBA games with friends, binging Netflix and anime, or taking walks outside.
