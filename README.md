### Why hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vincent Ahn and I am a software developer with experience in building complex web applications.

Currently I am working at Optum where I am integrating our Revenue Cycle Management system with Athena Health.

When I'm not coding, I usually spend my time playing FPS/MOBA games with friends, watching new movies (my favorite is Arrival directed by Denis Villeneuve), or taking walks outside.
