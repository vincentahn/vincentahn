### Why hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vincent Ahn and I am a software developer with experience building complex web applications using Javascript, Express.js, React, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

I recently finished the curriculum at App Academy, a highly selective and immersive Software Engineering bootcamp, where I spent 16 weeks refining my skills and exposing myself to many web development technologies in a fast paced environment.

When I'm not coding, I usually spend my time playing FPS/MOBA games, binging some seasonal anime, or getting fascinated by some new Japanese aspect/trivia.
